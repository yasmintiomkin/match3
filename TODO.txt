Detect trios:
Idea - Recursive loop starting the middle one going to neighbours 

GIT

Writing a game:
Step by step - in our case:
Generate board once (data + render)
Listen to input.space
Detect neighbours > mark them > set to 0
Update board (render) > per cell, SetActive=false if 0
==> The board will now have empty cells for neighbouring cells
==> Now we see that the algorithm is ok 

HW - do the animations

Change data grid values to classes 

Fix - initial position by:
Run
Move the camera
Copy component (camera)
Stop
Paste values (camera)

See tiles game ==> make the tiles according to screen size

Animations:
Each CellView knows if it's animating
In the BoardManager Update function => traverse cells and ask them if they finished animating
When animation finishes, run detect trios again

OR

Use coroutines
